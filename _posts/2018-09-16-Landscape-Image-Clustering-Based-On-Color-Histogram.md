title: Landscape Image Clustering Based on Color Histogram

My original thought about this project is to cluster the landscape images by their colors. I developed a web crawler to download 8892 landscape photos from [mob.org](https://wallpaper.mob.org/gallery/tag=landscape/).

However, I ran up against difficulty in extracting the color features from the images.
